   <h1> Community Based Solutions to Food Insecurity </h1> By Nahisha Jackson </p>
  <p style="text-align:left;">We rarely spend time thinking about where the food we eat comes from. When you reach for the bag of spinach at the grocery store, do you think of who and how that spinach ended up on that shelf? The people and land that grew, harvested, packaged that food are lost under the thin plastic bag. We are separated from what we put in our bodies everyday. While there is an abundance of food waste, there is also food injustice. 
     </p>
  <p style="text-align:left;"> The food problem is a result of colonial dispossession that prioritized profit over relationship and respect for the land. In the race for resources, food sources became the first thing <a href="https://www.eater.com/23981769/indigenous-food-health-colonization-climate-impact">controlled by imperial powers</a>
     on a global scale. This translates to present day, in communities of color across the U.S., <a href= "https://www.guernicamag.com/karen-washington-its-not-a-food-desert-its-food-apartheid/">food apartheid</a> and lack of access to healthy food prevails. This can look like <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/06/05/metro/were-being-ripped-off-teens-investigating-equity-find-stop-shop-charges-more-jackson-square-than-more-affluent-suburb/">inflating prices at the Jackson Square Stop n Shop</a>
      or grocery stores in Alaska where in 2016, <a href="https://www.firstnations.org/wp-content/uploads/publication-attachments/Food%20Price%20Index%202018FINALsmall.pdf">a gallon of milk cost $8.70</a>
      . Without a meaningful connection to our food systems, it’s difficult for us to have autonomy as communities.

    <p style="text-align:left;"> In recent years, people have popularized the term <a href="https://viacampesina.org/en/what-is-food-sovereignty/">food sovereignty</a>
      to describe the right for people to self-determination in their food systems. The concept of food sovereignty helps us imagine a world where we were intimately aware of and intertwined with the people and land that our food comes from. This could be as simple as the community or urban gardener who shares homegrown tomatoes with their neighbors. 
      <p style="text-align:left;"> The term was first defined by La Via Campesina, the international peasant movement.

   <blockquote> “Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts those who produce, distribute, and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.”

<p style="text-align: left;"> Oftentimes, solutions to food injustice exist within the nonprofit world. An organization has to be a registered 401c non profit organization in order to provide for communities. Feed the Hood and Pequoig Farm are two examples of self-determinative community responses to food injustice in Massachusetts. 
</p>

<h2> Pequoig Farm</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.pequoigfarm.org/">Pequoig Farm</a>
  spans 181 acres and was returned to Nimpuc stewardship this year. The Nimpuc people are the Indigenous peoples of southeastern, south central Massachusetts. and parts of northeastern Connecticut and Rhode Island. In a DS4Si event the Rez and the Hood on Tuesday, Oct. 22,, Pequoig Farm manager, KeelyCurliss spoke about the work that happens on Pequoig Farm. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> KeelyCurliss spoke about the importance of collectively defining food sovereignty. To her, food sovereignty is about interconnectivity and autonomy or the ability to secure and take care of all the components that make up the food system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> When asked about the politics behind her farming, KeelyCurliss mentioned three tenets - the need to interrogate hierarchy, agri-ecology, and connection to global struggle. 
  “Food and land is the basis for so much struggle,” said KeelyCurliss.

<p>Returning land to Indigenous stewardship enables tribes to preserve culturally specific growing practices and relationships to land. Being in right relationship with the land is integral to the way Pequoig Farm operates. 
</p>
<p>“Seeing crops through from seed to fruit makes you more aware attuned to the Earth,” KeelyCurliss said.</p>
<p>When people are fed well and connected to their food sources, it provides fuel for other kinds of political organizing. The struggle for Indigenous self-determination and sovereignty, housing justice, reproductive justice, disability justice are all a part of food justice. </p>
<p>All food grown on Pequoig Farm is distributed to tribal members free of charge. </p>

<h2> Feed the Hood </h2>
<div class = text>
  <p> Every Sunday, Bostonians from across different neighborhoods flock to the People’s Free Store in Jamaica Plain on Centre St.. These community members are participating in mutual aid food distribution. Going door to door providing working-class families of color with groceries for the week. In 2015, in Suffolk County, Mass., there were <a href="https://datacommon.mapc.org/browser/datasets/323">131,730 people facing food insecurity</a>
    . <a href="https://www.instagram.com/healthehoodhth/?hl=en">Feed the Hood</a>
    is a community response to this fact and need. 
  </p>

  <p> I spoke with Slim, one of the creators of the People’s Free Store and Feed the Hood. At Feed the Hood, the power is in the hands of the community members, they do not rely on monetary donations from any governing organization or board of directors. </p>
  <p> As Slim puts it, “We provide the solutions to those who can’t afford those other nonprofits” or don’t qualify.</p>
  <p> “We don’t have a 100k budget, we got a what we can work with at the time budget,” said Slim.  </p>
  <p> This is an important piece of addressing food insecurity in Boston. Sometimes, there are barriers to who has access to government resources. Highly specified qualifications created by nonprofit board members, government officials, or corporations determine who receives aid. By taking away these barriers and qualifiers, makes Feed the Hood unique. You don’t have to prove anything to be deserving of getting your basic needs, like food access, met.
  </p>
  <p> The very thing that makes the Feed the Hood program unique is also a limitation and struggle. Yet, every Sunday is a testament of the power of community. Feed the Hood is powered by the connection built between community members. The organizers are clear about where they get their food, folks working at grocery stores provide boxes of perishable and nonperishable foods to the organization.</p>
  <p> When I helped with distribution, the weekend before the Day of Mourning, the People’s Free Store was filled with volunteers ready to lend their car, strength, and organizational skills to pack up grocery bags for families and load up cars ready for drop off.</p>
  <p> Feed the Hood isn’t just about food, it’s also about connecting with organizers and community from all other Boston and sharing about your day, plans for the week, meeting new and familiar faces, and checking in. </p>
  <p> 
    Pequoig Farm and Heal the Hood are examples of applying the principles of <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/dean-spade-mutual-aid">mutual aid</a>
    and food sovereignty to face food insecurity. Food is the basis for community and connection. So, creating spaces where people are not seen as charity is important. My need to eat and be fed well is also intertwined with my neighbor’s need to eat and be fed well. It is within our power to recognize and develop solutions with one another to address systemic, manufactured food scarcity.</p>
